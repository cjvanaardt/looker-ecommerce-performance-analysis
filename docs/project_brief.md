# TheLook Ecommerce Performance & Customer Insights - Brief

## Purpose
As a data analyst in TheLook's central data team, you are to provide decision-support insights across Marketing, Customer Grow (CRM), Product & Merchandising, and Operations. The focus of this work is to understand performance drivers, diagnose issues, and inform near-term (6-12 month) planning through clear, evidence-backed recommendations.

## Business Context
TheLook operates a large-scale e-commerce platform in a competitive retail environment. Growth depends on effective customer acquisition and retention, profitable product assortments, and operational efficiency as order volume scales. Multiple teams rely on shared data to make decisions, but require tailored insights aligned to their specific objectives.

## Team-Focused Questions
### Customer Growth / CRM
**Problem**: Retention and long-term customer value are critical as acquisition costs rise.
- How have retention and repeat purchase patterns changed over the last 24–36 months, segmented by acquisition channel, demographics (age/gender), and location?
- Which customer behaviours best predict long-term value (e.g. first-purchase category, AOV, time to second order), where long-term value is defined by revenue, profit, and repeat purchases?
- Which customer groups consistently drive disproportionate revenue?
- Where do post-purchase drop-offs occur (e.g. returns, low engagement), and how do these vary by segment?

**Decisions Supported**: Retention initiatives, loyalty programs, customer prioritisation.

### Product and Merchandising
**Problem**: Broad assortments increase inventory risk and margin pressure.
- Which categories and brands have underperformed over the last 24–36 months, considering sales volume, gross margin, sell-through, and returns?
- How do product performance metrics vary by seasonality, price tier, or proximity to distribution centres?
- What product-level patterns are associated with higher return rates (e.g. category, brand-specific issues)?
- Where do returns materially reduce margin?
- Which products drive revenue while disproportionately increasing operational or return-related costs?
**Decisions Supported**: Assortment optimisation, pricing focus, product lifecycle decisions.

### Operations

**Problem**: Order growth must be supported without disproportionate fulfilment cost.
- How are sales volume, AOV, and customer density distributed across regions, and how has this changed over the last 36 months?
- Which regions demonstrate the fastest growth and highest long-term potential?
- Are certain regions operationally inefficient relative to revenue contribution?
- What is the relationship between customer-to-distribution-centre distance and key metrics (e.g. delivery time, returns, cart abandonment)?
- Where could targeted operational investment deliver the highest impact?
**Decisions Supported**: Fulfilment planning, geographic prioritisation, risk management

## Deliverables
- **Executive Report**:
A structured executive report containing Power BI visualisations, forming a core component of the quarterly stakeholder reporting pack. The report will synthesise key findings, risks, and recommendations across teams.

- **Stakeholder Presentation**:
A 20–30 minute presentation delivered during the quarterly stakeholder meeting, presenting the findings of the executive report to senior stakeholders, supported by Power BI dashboards.

- **Analysis Documentation**:
Full documentation of the analysis, assumptions, and data limitations in a version-controlled GitHub repository to support transparency, reproducibility, and future iteration.
