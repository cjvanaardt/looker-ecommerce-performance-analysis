### Project Brief

**E-commerce Performance & Diagnostic Analysis**
#### Business context

This analysis is conducted by the central data team of a mid-to-large e-commerce business operating across multiple product categories and markets. Leadership has observed variability in recent commercial performance and is seeking a clearer, evidence-based understanding of how the business is performing and which areas are driving change.

The objective of this work is to support informed discussion during a **quarterly executive performance review**, align stakeholders on current performance trends, and identify priority areas for further investigation or action.

#### Audience

This analysis is intended for a mixed audience:

- **Executive leadership (primary audience)** — CEO, COO, Head of Commercial  
    Focused on high-level performance, drivers of change, and implications for near-term decisions.
- **Commercial and product stakeholders (secondary audience)** — category leads, product managers  
    Interested in segment-level performance to guide prioritisation.
- **Data and analytics peers (tertiary audience)** — analysts and analytics engineers  
    Ensure clarity of metric definitions, assumptions, and analytical robustness.

#### Time horizon

The analysis focuses on the **most recent 12–18 months** of available data.  
This window is long enough to identify meaningful trends while remaining relevant to near-term decision-making.

---

#### Primary executive question

**How has overall e-commerce performance changed over the past year, and which areas are driving those changes?**

This question anchors the analysis and provides a high-level view of commercial health.

#### Supporting executive questions

##### 1. Performance overview

**How have key commercial metrics evolved over time, and are recent changes materially different from historical patterns?**

This establishes what is happening at the topline and whether observed changes represent normal variability or meaningful shifts.

---
##### 2. Segment drivers

**Which product categories, markets, or customer segments are contributing most to changes in overall performance?**

This moves beyond topline metrics to identify where performance is strengthening or deteriorating.

---
##### 3. Decomposition of change

**Are observed performance changes primarily driven by volume, pricing, or product mix effects?**

This diagnostic step helps explain _why_ performance is changing, not just where.

---
##### 4. Emerging risks and opportunities

**Are there early indicators of emerging risks or opportunities that warrant further investigation or action?**

This frames the analysis toward forward-looking decision support without over-claiming certainty.

---

#### Decision relevance

The insights from this analysis are intended to inform:

- Commercial and category prioritisation
- Areas requiring deeper investigation
- Metrics and segments that warrant closer ongoing monitoring

The analysis provides **directional, evidence-based guidance**, not definitive causal conclusions.

---

#### Explicitly out of scope

To maintain focus and credibility, this analysis does not attempt to:

- Forecast future performance
- Perform marketing attribution or causal inference
- Optimise pricing or assortment strategies
